You've done it! You've gotten an interview for a super awesome job!

Now you've just got to make it through the tech interview...fun!

They've given you a list of questions that they'd like you whiteboard.
The company is gSchool and they've only got three whiteboards, though, so you've got to work in teams.

Enjoy!

1. Given a sentence, how would you reproduce it so that every odd word is printed backwards?

  ex:
   "Puppies are super duper cute. I love puppies."

   becomes:  "Puppies era super repud cute. I love seisppup."

   (note: the first word is 0, so it counts as even)


2. How would you sort the values in a hash by the length of the key.

  ex: { "corgi" => "the cutest", "border collie" => "smart", "chihuahua" => "yappy"}

  becomes: ["the cutest", "yappy", "smart"]


3. How would you design a parking lot? It needs to have regular, compact and handicapped spaces. It
    should also keep track of how many spots are empty and filled.


4. Design the data structure for a generic deck of cards. How would you subclass the data structures to implement Blackjack?


5. Given a list of words, how would you write a program to find the longest word made up of the other words in the list?

  ex: [cat, banana, dog, nana, walk, walker, dogwalker]

  returns 'dogwalker'
